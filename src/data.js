He picked up the work very quickly and was very thorough in his approach every time we discussed on a problem, be it technical or functional. The best part I liked was his attention to minute details, and coming up with questions/queries that just seemed appropriate. He has a very good understanding of java and related technologies. Working with him is always a pleasure.",
